# Cryptopals Challenges

I will be using this repo to complete the [Cryptopals Challenges](http://cryptopals.com/) in Go. Most of the challenges are pretty short, so I probably won't be doing unit tests. There are already Go attepts on Github for these challenges, but I will be doing them without looking unless I'm very stuck. I probably won't spend a ton of time on code quality, but I will at least have the challenge instructions in comments. I'm not committing to a timeline because I have a few other projects going at the moment.

# Run

Keep it simple and run with `go run main.go`, or you can run `go build` followed by `.\cryptopals.exe`.

Once I am into the second set, you will need to follow the command with an integer prepresenting the set you are running.

# Status

Stuck on ex 2 of set 1. I might be interpreting the instructions wrong... or XORing wrong.

# License

My code is available under an MIT license, if you should find a use for it. The text of the excercises is copyright the authors, whom appear to be Thomas Ptacek, Sean Devlin, Alex Balducci, and Marcin Wielgoszewski, but the [cryptopals site](http://cryptopals.com/) does not appear to provide a clear statement of licensing for data files and exercise descriptions, so I would advise against attempting to use the content for profit, but educational / academic use seems to be clearly intended.
