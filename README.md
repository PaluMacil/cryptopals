# Cryptopals Challenges

I will be using this repo to complete the [Cryptopals Challenges](http://cryptopals.com/) in Go. Most of the challenges are pretty short, so I probably won't be doing unit tests. There are already Go attepts on Github for these challenges, but I will be doing them without looking unless I'm very stuck. I probably won't spend a ton of time on code quality, but I will at least have the challenge instructions in comments.

# Run

Keep it simple and run with `go run main.go`.

# License

My code is available under an MIT license, if you should find a use for it. The text of the excercises is copyright the authors, whom appear to be Thomas Ptacek, Sean Devlin, Alex Balducci, and Marcin Wielgoszewski, but the cryptopals site does not appear to provide a clear statement of licensing for data files and exercise descriptions, so I would advise against attempting to use the content for profit, but educational / academic use seems to be clearly intended.
